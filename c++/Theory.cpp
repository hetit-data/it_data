What is OOP?


-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming based on the concept of object
which are instances of classes. Objects can contain both data and methods that operate on the 
data.OOP allows for the modeling of real-world entities and relationships, promoting code reusability,
scalability, and organization.


->Classes and Objects:

Classes: Blueprints for creating objects, defining properties (data) and behaviors (methods).
Objects: Instances of classes, representing entities with specific states and behaviors.blue print of class.

->Encapsulation:

The practice of bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). 

->Inheritance:

A mechanism for creating new classes based on existing ones. It allows the new class (subclass)
 to inherit properties and behaviors from the existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse and hierarchy.

->Polymorphism:

The ability of different classes to be used again through a common interface. 
It allows for methods to be defined in the superclass and overridden in subclasses.
-two type
 -method overload,method overriding
 
 
->Abstraction:

The process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.
 It simplifies interaction with objects.
 
->Difference between OOP and POP
->OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
	
Structure: Organizes code into classes and objects, focusing on data and behaviors encapsulated within objects.
Modularity: Promotes code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism, making it easier to extend and maintain code.
Data Security: Provides encapsulation, allowing data hiding and protection.
Complexity: Well-suited for complex and large software systems, modeling real-world entities and relationships.

->POP (Procedural-Oriented Programming):
	
Structure: Organizes code into procedures or functions, focusing on sequential execution of instructions.
Modularity: Code reuse is achieved through functions and procedures, but lacks inheritance and polymorphism.
Data Security: Data is often shared globally, leading to potential issues with data integrity and security.
Complexity: More suited for simple and smaller programs with straightforward, linear tasks.
